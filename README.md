# shellemb
An interactive C command execution shell programmed for embedded devices(more specifically tested in routers) in a client/server scenario. The objective of this project is to work similarly to a ncat tool, but saving space and being as light as possible to not occupy too much of embedded's memory. In here you will find the source code and binaries already compiled and some of them stripped for some architectures. If you wish to use it for a architecture that is not present in binaries, just grab the code and compile it with -static flag.
